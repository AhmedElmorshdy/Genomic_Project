# Genome Error Detection 

Recent advancements in sequencing machines have rapidly improved 
our ability to study genomic material at an unprecedented scale. 
Despite substantial improvements in sequencing technologies, errors 
present in the data still risk confounding downstream analysis and 
limiting the applicability of sequencing technologies. Computational 
error correction promises to eliminate sequencing errors, but the 
relative accuracy of error correction algorithms remains unknown. So, 
we aim to develop software dealing with different biological data using 
artificial intelligence technology to detect a specific error resulting about 
machine sequence and try to correct it to get best accuracy.
